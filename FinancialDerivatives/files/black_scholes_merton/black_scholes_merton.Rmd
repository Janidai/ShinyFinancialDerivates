The Black-Scholes Formula also known as Black-Scholes-Merton Model, is a mathematical model for pricing European Options.

## Call Option
The formula for a European Call option on a stock that pays dividends at the continuous rate $\delta$ is:
$$
\begin{equation}
	C(S,K,\sigma,r,T,\delta)= S e^{-\delta T} N(d_1) - K e^{-rT} N(d_2) 
\end{equation}
$$

Where:  

- $C =$ Call option price  
- $S =$ Current stock price  
- $K =$ Strike price of the option  
- $r =$ risk-free interest rate (a number between 0 and 1)  
- $\sigma =$ volatility of the stocks return (a number between 0 and 1)  
- $T =$ time to option maturity (in years)  
- $N =$ normal cumulative distribution function  
- $\delta =$ The dividend yield on the stock  

and:
$$
\begin{equation}
	d_1= \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{T}} \left[\ln{\left(\frac{S}{K}\right)} + \left(r-\delta + \frac{\sigma^2}{2} \right)T \right]
\end{equation}
$$
$$
\begin{equation}
	d_2= d_1-\sigma \sqrt{\mathrm T}
\end{equation}
$$
## Put Option
The formula for a European Put option on a stock that pays dividends at the continuous rate $\delta$, follows from put-call parity is:

$$
\begin{equation}
	P(S,K,\sigma,r,T,\delta)= K e^{-rT} N(-d_2) - S e^{-\delta T} N(-d_1)
\end{equation}
$$
